# Zeckendorf Representation


I read a blog post titled
[The golden ratio as a number base](https://apieceofthepi.substack.com/p/the-golden-ratio-as-a-number-base).
It had an interesting statement:

> According to Zeckendorf's Theorem, every positive integer can be
> represented in a unique way as a sum of distinct, non-consecutive Fibonacci
> numbers.

The Wikipedia page for [Zeckendorf's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf's_theorem)
has a slightly tighter wording for that statement.
